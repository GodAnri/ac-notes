# Data Mining Process
## Data Mining
It is the non-trivial process of identifying patterns of data that are:
- implicit;
- valid;
- novel (comparing to expected values);
- potentially useful (lead to useful actions);
- understandable (to humans).

It is a step in the KDD (Knowledge and Discovery of Data) process:
- Cleaning and Integration;
- Selection and Transformation;
- **Data Mining**;
- Evaluation and Presentation;
- Knowledge.

### Methodologies:
Examples: CRISP-DM, SCRUM-DM, SEMMA, etc.

**CRISP-DM** (**CR**oss-**I**ndustry **S**tandard **P**rocess for **D**ata **M**ining):
- European Community funded effort aiming to:
    - cheaper, faster, more reliable DM;
    - widespread adoption;
    - reduce skills required for DM;
    - capture experience for reuse.
- Characteristics:
    - non-proprietary;
    - application/industry/tool neutral;
    - focus on business issues as well as technical analysis;
    - framework for guidance;
    - experience-based templates for analysis.
- Phases:
    - Business Understanding (business goals and data mining goals);
    - Data Understanding (collect, describe, explore and verify initial data);
    - Data Preparation (select, clean, construct, integrate and format data);
    - Modelling (select technique and build and assess model);
    - Evaluation (evaluate results and review process);
    - Deployment (plan deployment, monitoring and maintenance, produce final report and review project).

80% of the interesting information of a DM project can be extracted using SQL; 20% of hidden information requires more advanced techniques.
